# Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in Practice
This repository accompanies the thesis titled "Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in Practice", which contains a comprehensive analysis of the relative performance, efficiency, privacy, and limitations of various privacy-preserving machine learning approaches on real-world datasets. The goal of this repository is to promote open science principles and reproducibility by sharing the research process and materials.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my primary thesis advisor, Nitin Kohli, for his unwavering support, invaluable guidance, and insightful feedback throughout the entire research process. His knowledge and expertise have been instrumental in shaping this work. 

I am also grateful to my thesis advisor, Professor Gerald Friedland, for his valuable input and feedback, which greatly contributed to the refinement of this thesis.

Additionally, this endeavor would not have been possible without the generous support from Professors Eric Van Dusen and Narges Norouzi. I would also like to acknowledge and thank my peers in DATA H195A/B for their ongoing feedback and support, which have been instrumental in shaping my research.
